									<h2>Introduction</h2>
									<p class="about">Be part of a weekend of <strong>ideas, innovation and impact</strong> by participating in 180 Degrees Consulting’s inaugural Social Impact Hackathon.</p>

<p class="about">This Social Impact Hackathon will be held in conjunction with <strong><a href="http://www.outforaustralia.org/" target="_blank">Out For Australia</a></strong>, which is a volunteer-run non-for-profit that seeks to support and mentor aspiring LGBTIQ+ students and professionals navigate their way through the early stages of their career. </p>

<p>Despite marriage equality and increasing push for Safe Schools, research shows that <strong>only 32% of LGBTIQ+ people are out</strong> to everyone with whom they work, and this is <strong>even lower for young LGBTIQ+ people</strong>. Over the course of a weekend, you will help Out For Australia solve a strategic issue and be part of shaping a safer and more diverse and inclusive workplace in teams of 4-5.</p>

<p class="about">The event will bring together talented and innovative students, industry mentors and representatives from Out for Australia to co-design a strategy to empower inclusion and sense of community among LGBTIQ+ professionals and students. We invite anyone with <strong>bright ideas, appetite for problem-solving and a genuine desire to make a social difference</strong> to <a href="#three">register</a> today!</p>

									<h2>Launch: Monday October 15</h2>
									<p class="about">We will kick off the Hackathon with a <strong>2 hour information session</strong>, where we will run through the agendas of both days in depth and discuss the best ways to prepare for the Hackathon. We will also be <strong>inviting a sponsor</strong> to come give a workshop to give you some tips as to how to approach the problem-solving aspect of the Hackathon. This is also a great opportunity to <strong>meet other hackers and our community partners</strong>.</p>

									<p>We will be releasing the case (+ helpful resources!) on <strong>October 17</strong> when registrations close. The information session is vital so when the case is released, you'll be well equipped to work with your teammates to come up with creative strategies to help Out For Australia with their problem brief!</p>

															<li><a href="#7">I still have another question, who can I talk to?</a></li>
								</ul>

								<p><a id="1"></a><strong>Who can attend?</strong><br />
									All students from the University of Sydney are invited to attend. All current 180 Degrees Consulting consultants from the University of New South Wales and Macquarie University can also attend. </p>
									<p>Since this is our first time running the Hackathon, we want to pilot it successfully before rolling registrations out to universities Sydney-wide in future Hackathons.</p>

<p><strong><a id="2"></a>Do I need to know how to code?</strong><br />
Nope! The Hackathon is focused on strategy rather than product. If you have technical skills and would like to use them to create a prototype, then feel free! However, not coding a solution will not disadvantage you.</p>

<p><strong><a id="#3"></a>What if I don’t have a team?</strong><br />
You can still sign up <a href="https://form.jotform.co/82683544484871">here</a> and we will do our best to put you into a team. <strong>Your application will not be disadvantaged if you are applying as an individual!</strong></p>

<p><strong><a id="#4"></a>Will there be food?</strong><br />
Lunch will be provided for both days, but feel free to bring your own snacks so that you refuel throughout the event!</p>

<p><strong><a id="#5"></a>What if I don't have experience in social impact work?</strong><br />
	You don't have to be already saving the world to start making a difference! We will have mentors and Out For Australia representatives there on the day to guide you through whatever questions you may have.</p>

<p><strong><a id="#6"></a>I know 180 Degrees Consulting is mainly a consultancy service. What if I haven't consulted before in the past?</strong><br />
	Prior consulting knowledge is <strong>not necessary</strong>. We strongly encourage anyone interested to attend our briefing event on Monday October 15 to find out more about the Hackathon and to attend some sponsor-led workshops that should equip you with some tools that will help you through October 20-21. We will also be providing resources before and on the day of the Hacakthon to make sure students of all skillsets and experience levels are catered for. Our mentors will also guide you through any methodologies you may find confusing. <strong>You will not be disadvantaged if you don't have prior consulting experience!</strong>.
</p>

<p><strong><a id="#7"></a>I still have another question, who can I talk to?</strong><br />
Still not sure what to expect? Wondering whether you have the right knowledge or skills? Have all your questions answered at our information session before the event on 15 October. Register your interest in the Hackathon and we will give you more details closer to the date.</p>

<p>We will run through the event and provide you with some tips and training to prepare you for the Hackathon, and you will have the opportunity to hear from people who have participated in other Hackathons in the past.</p>
